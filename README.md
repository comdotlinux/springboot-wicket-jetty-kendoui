# springboot-wicket-jetty-kendoui
A Spring Boot project that uses Apache Wicket and Jetty with infinite scrolling using Wicket-kendo-ui

Here the database is not persistant, instead it is generated using a simple form and then used going forward.

To run it simply run the class with the main method or package and run with java -jar package.jar

Will add some code soon.
